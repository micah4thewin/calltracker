**Overview**
This program is designed to encourage habit creation through passive design and simplicity. It aims to help reps develop positive behaviors by integrating them into daily activities in a way that doesn't create more work and is kinda fun. The program is structured around call sessions, during which users can select and track specific behaviors.

**Features**

    Call Session Management: Users can start and end call sessions, during which they can select behaviors to focus on.
    Behavior Tracking: The program provides a list of behaviors with examples and encouragements to help users integrate these habits into their routine.
    Progress Visualization: A progress bar updates in real-time to show the completion percentage of selected behaviors during a call session.
    Daily Summary: At the end of each day, users can download a summary of their activities, including total calls and behavior completion statistics.
    Local Data Storage: All data is stored locally on the user's device using LocalForage, ensuring privacy and security.

**Security and CPNI**
No data is sent to any external servers or third-party services. All information related to call sessions and behavior tracking is stored locally on the user's device. This ensures that users can engage with the program without concerns about data security or privacy breaches. There are no analytics either.
